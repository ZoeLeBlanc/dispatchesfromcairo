Here are the slides from my SHAFR 2016 slide deck for the panel I co-organized , ‘Bridging the Two DHs: Digital History and Diplomatic History.’ I might eventually upload the full paper, though much of the material is repeated throughout the site.

Since starting to present at SHAFR in 2014, I was always surprised at the lack of DH since the AHA and other big conferences have increasingly embraced digital projects. A large motivation for organizing this panel was to start a discussion at SHAFR for interested historians on how to integrate digital into diplomatic histories. (My other motivation was more self-interested - a chance to meet some of the leaders in DH on the panel).

I'm presenting on Friday, and so I hope the panel ends up being a productive conversation. There's a high probability that my paper will fall flat since it's more of a methods than research piece. But regardless, I'm excited that I get a chance to share some ideas that have been knocking around in my head for a few years.
