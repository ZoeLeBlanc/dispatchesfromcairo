While much of the impetus for this project was to start a discussion about sharing diplomatic sources between historians, there are a number of obstacles to outright sharing sources. One area that might be have a lower barrier to entry is to share meta-data about these sources.

At the moment, the finding guides available online through the NARA website do not list the number of boxes, titles of folders, or number of documents in each file. Below is a visualization of all the boxes in the Record Group 84, Egypt US Embassy Cairo Records for both Classified and Unclassified. If you hover over a section, you can see the folder name and number of documents.

While this analysis seems pretty straightforward, even getting a sense of what is in which box and folder can help researchers focus their efforts. I created the visualization using google sheets.
