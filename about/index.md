Dispatches From Cairo is a digital and diplomatic history exploring diplomatic cables from Cairo from 1955-1965. The project uses embassy records that are declassified to explore the discourses, events, and people that were of interest to embassy officials. While embassy archives only represent a fraction of the materials produced by these officials, the existing declassified archive still represents an abundance of historical sources. This project aims to:

* explore the utility of digital history methods to diplomatic history
* explore the prospects of digitizing diplomatic archives
* explore the possibility of sharing diplomatic archives

This project was started as a companion piece to my SHAFR 2016 paper, and over the next few months I plan to update the project as I process additional materials.
